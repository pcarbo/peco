Description: A supervised approach for predicting cell cycle
  progression in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using
  scRNA-seq data. We provide gene-specific estimates of cyclic
  trends of gene expression based on our training data. These
  gene-specific estimates can be applied to other scRNA-seq data to
  predict cell cycle phases (measured as angles on a unit
  circle). The training data consists of fluorescence imaging data
  and scRNA-seq data from iPSCs derived from 6 Yoruba cell lines.
